            I've loved Python since I took <a href="https://sixohone.mit.edu">6.01</a> (Intro EECS).
            We used it at MIT for research, for homework, and for doing Matlab work <a
                href="https://matplotlib.org/">without Matlab</a>, and I've used it since for my scripts and projects.
            I was a Lab Assistant for 6.01 and <a
                href="https://web.mit.edu/6.02/">6.02</a> (Intro EECS II), and I helped teach an Intro to Python class
            during our January period. I am a part of InfoScout's <a
                href="http://infoscout.co/solutions/insights">Insights</a> team since Feb 2017, which means
            working with <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com">Django</a>, <a
                href="http://www.celeryproject.org">Celery</a>, <a href="https://www.sqlalchemy.org/">SQLAlchemy</a> and

        <div class="blurb">I've worked with Java since 2011, when I took <a
                href="http://web.mit.edu/6.005/">6.005</a> (I used Eclipse and <em>hated</em> it). After
            college, I worked on the <a

            Components (ADFShare) team at Oracle from July 2013 until January 2017. We used (and developed components
            for)
            <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/developer-tools/jdev/overview/index-094652.html">JDeveloper</a>;
            one of my first projects at Oracle was adding internal static-member audits to JDeveloper. I have
            my qualms about Java, but <a
                    href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/overview/java8-2100321.html">Java 8</a>
            looks promising, with type annotations, lambda expressions and method references.
